# Battlefield V LAN Party Invite/Flyer

by Cory Evan Wright (@BeSublime)

## Editing Instructions
The platoon logo is swappable, just double click the Logo layer's thumbnail in the layers panel to open the smart object, and replace with your platoon's logo. You can grab it from the background on your Battlefield [career page](https://www.battlefield.com/companion/career/).

Feel free to delete the beer star if you're not cool enough to include awesome brews for your guests.
